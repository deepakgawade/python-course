// Use interface to prevent users from reusing your class's code while allowing them to re-implement its interface.

// Use base to require users to reuse your class's code and ensure every instance of your class's type is an instance of that actual class or a subclass.

// Use final to completely prevent a class from being extended.

// Use sealed to opt in to exhaustiveness checking on a family of subtypes.
